Project Examples
=====================

This git repo contains an example of code I wrote over the summer at edX and code that I also wrote over the summer at Noodle Education.

edx_rq3snaDirected_TimeSeries.py is a python script written by Jennifer DeBoer that converts a csv pulled from a SQL database to a .gexf file ready to be displayed in Gephi. I edited the primary function, and this semester, plan to implement grouping attributes with edges to enrichen the social network graphs.

noodle_examples contains several scripts that demonstrate my working abilities in python. For instance, noodle-bls_class.py demonstrates my working ability with classes. noodle_bls_class.py demonstrates my working ability with classes and functions. noodle_districts_final.py demonstrates my ability writing scripts for scraping websites such as wikipedia. noodle_merge_finegold demonstrates my working ability with reading and writing files.

finegold_s_hw4 is a homework from my datascience course last fall. The main file is HW4.ipynb which contains the homework in which I implement a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model and a factor-based collaborative filtering model.
